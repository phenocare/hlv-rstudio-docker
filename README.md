# hlv-rstudio-docker
a docker with rstudio and hastaLaVista R package.

Instead of configuring [hastaLaVista](https://github.com/jwist/hastaLaVista) R package for your need you can simple use this docker that comes with rstudio and all packages you need for metabolomics, including [MetaboMate](https://github.com/kimsche/MetaboMate) R package.

You can use this Dockerfile to build and modify our own container, otherwise you can just get it installed using:

```
docker pull phenocare/hastalavista
```
